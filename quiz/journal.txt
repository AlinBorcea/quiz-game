package quiz

1. Submodule quiz.go
It contains the interface of the package and handles every operation both on the
quiz and question data types. It validates user input and provides results if 
possible.

2. Submodule question.go
It translates a given record into an easier to use variable and returns 
the variable to be used either internally, in the package, or outside. The 
question and the possible answers are exported while the correct answer index
is kept inside the package in order not to be abused by calling code.
